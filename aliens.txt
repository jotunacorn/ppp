You may only use this power once per encounter.
Cryo @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Resource @ Saves cards for later @ You have the power to Preserve.

As a main player or ally, after you win an encounter in which you have at least one ship, use this power to capture any losing ships, stacking them under one or more of your ships in the encounter instead of sending them to the warp (effects that would save ships from the warp, such as Zombie's or Healer's power, cannot prevent this). Captured ships do not have special characteristics, e.g., Macron ships are not worth four. These stacks are controlled by you. Each stack is considered to be one ship for purposes of play.

As a main player, when collecting compensation, you may use this power to choose the player that you are collecting compensation from, whether that player was your opponent or not. You then look through that player's hand and choose the cards you want for compensation.//In addition, when your opponent collects compensation from you, you may use this power to select the cards he or she gets.
Hate @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Rules @ Opponents lose cards or ships @ You have the power of Rage. At the start of your turn, use this power to force every player to either discard a card or lose ships. First, choose and discard a card from your hand. Every other player must then choose to either discard a card of the same type (attack, negotiate, artifact, etc.) or lose three ships of your choice to the warp. If you discard an attack card, your opponents must discard an attack card of equal or higher value. If an opponent has no cards of the discarded type, he or she must lose ships instead. If, after using this power, you do not have any encounter cards in your hand, draw a new hand.
Healer @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Resource @ Can save others' ships from warp @ You have the power to Heal. When another player loses ships to the warp or has ships removed from the game, you may use this power to return to that player all the ships he or she just lost and earn one card from the deck. Being healed does not prevent a player from receiving compensation. A healed player replaces his or her ships on any of his or her colonies. During an encounter you may heal several players, drawing one card for each.
Horde @Cosmic Alliance @Red @Resource @ Gains tokens that act as ships @ You have the power to Spawn. Each time you draw a card or retrieve a ship from the warp, use this power. Add a horde token to one of your colonies. Treat horde tokens as ships under your control, but discard them if sent to the warp, removed from the game, or captured by another player. If you lose this power, horde tokens remain until discarded.//Your power cannot be stolen or copied through any means.
Host @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Resource @ Plays and adds unused flares @ You have the power to Channel. At the start of any player's turn, you may remove any or all flares on this sheet from the game, and/or draw cards from the unused flare deck to place facedown on this sheet until you have three here, in either order.//At any time, you may use this power to play a wild flare from this sheet as though it were in your hand. If the flare would return to your hand after use, discard it to the regular discard pile. If you are zapped, place the flare back on this sheet. Cards played from this sheet do not count toward the normal limit of one flare per encounter.
Human @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Combat @ Mostly harmless @ You have the power of Humanity. As a main player or ally, after encounter cards are revealed, use this power to add 4 to your side's total. If this power is zapped, however, your side automatically wins the encounter.
Industrialist @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Combat @ Adds losing attack cards @ You have the power to Build. As a main player, after you lose an encounter in which you have revealed an attack card, your opponent must either allow you to win the encounter instead of losing, or else allow you to pace your attack card faceup on this sheet, adding it to your "stack". Your stack is not part of your hand and cannot be drawn from by other players or affected by other powers.//As a main player, after you reveal an attack card, use this power to either add or subtract the total of all the faceup attack cards in your stack from your side's total. For instance, if you have an attack 08 and an attack 12 on this sheet, you would add or subtract 20 from your side's total.
Invader @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Resource @ Launches Sneak attacks @ Game Setup: Shuffle the three "Invasion!" destiny cards into the destiny deck. These destiny cards allow you to have an extra encounter when drawn during another player's turn. After you have an extra encounter due to an "Invasion!" destiny card, the player who drew it during his or her turn receives another encounter.//You have the power of Invasion. As a main player, after an "Invasion!" destiny card or destiny card of your player color is drawn, you may use this power to discard your entire hand and draw a new hand of eight cards before having your extra encounter. Only use this power once per encounter.
Joker @Cosmic Dominion @Red @Rules @ Makes attack cards wild @ Game Setup: Take the nine joker tokens (six different attacks, a regular negotiate, a morph, and a retreat) and place them faceup on this sheet.//You have the power of Wild Cards. Attack 08 cards are initially "wild". At the start of your turn, you may name any other attack card to become the new wild card instead.//After encounter cards are revealed, for each one that matches the current wild card, use this power. Place one faceup joker token from this sheet on the wild card to change it into the card indicated by the token. After the outcome is determined, return the used joker token(s) to this sheet, facedown. When you remove the last faceup joker token from this sheet, immediately turn the used ones here faceup for reuse.
Judge @Cosmic Dominion @Red @Rules @ Assigns extra win/lose terms @ You have the power of Fiat. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to declare any extra gains that either the winner or the loser (but not both) will get if an attack card is revealed. These extra gains are limited by the rules on deals: one colony where the opponent has a colony and/or card(s) from the opponent. For example, you may declare "the winner will also get all of the loser's cards, and an extra colony on any planet where the loser has a colony." The fiat is in addition to the normal results, and happens at the end of the encounter.
Kamikaze @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Resource @ Sacrifices ships for cards @ You have the power of Sacrifice. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to send up to four of your ships from any of your colonies to the warp. For every ship you sent to the warp, draw two cards from the deck. If this power is zapped, you do not lose the sacrificed ships to the warp.
Laser @Cosmic Dominion @Green @Combat @ Blinds opponent to part of hand @ You have the Power to Blind. As a main player, before allies are invited, use this power. If your opponent will need to draw a new hand to obtain encounter cards, he or she does so now. Then, you select at random a number of cards in his or her hand (without looking at them) up to the number of ships he or she has in the encounter. Your opponent must set the selected cards aside for the rest of the encounter.//If your opponent has no encounter cards after being blinded, he or she loses the encounter. Otherwise, the encounter proceeds normally. At the end of the encounter, your opponent retrieves the cards that were set aside.
Leviathan @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Combat @ May attack with planet @ You have the power of Worldships. As the offense, after the hyperspace gate is aimed, you may use this power to choose one of your home planets that has no opposing ships on it and send it through the gate to attack as a worldship. Take the worldship (with all of your ships that were on it) and place it on the hyperspace gate. After encounter cards are revealed add 20 to your side's total, plus 1 for each ship you have on your worldship. If you lose the encounter, return the worldship to your home system, sending all ships on it to the warp. If you win the encounter, return the worldships to your home system with your ships still on it, although you may leave one to four ships behind on the planet you successfully attacked.
Lightning @Cosmic Alliance @Yellow @Rules @ Gains and takes away encounters @ You have the power of Speed. Each time any other player takes a second encounter during his or her turn, use this power to add a token to this sheet.//After the end of any encounter (even your own), you may discard three tokens from this sheet to immediately have one encounter. Afterwards, play resumes from where it left off.//Alternately, at the start of a player's second encounter, you may discard two tokens from this sheet to immediately end the encounter.
Lizard @Cosmic Dominion @Green @Combat @ Metamorphoses after winning @ Game Setup: Choose one unused player color and place all the ships of that color on this sheet. Do not use this power unless you have an unused player color.//You have the power to Transmogrify. As a main player, after you win an encounter using any of your normal ships, use this power to morph those winning normal ships. Remove them from the game and replace them with an equal number from this sheet. Your morphed ships count as ships of your color, except that each one adds an extra +2 to your side's total when involved in an encounter as a main player or ally (even after this power is zapped or lost).//When you have no normal ships remaining in the game, you win the game. You may still win the game via the normal method.//This power cannot be stolen, copied, or separated from your player color through any means.
Locust @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Rules @ Eats planets when alone @ You have the power to Devour. At the start of any regroup phase, if you have a foreign colony on a planet by yourself (i.e., there are no other ships on the planet with you), use this power to devour the planet, removing it from the game and placing it on this sheet. Your ships on that planet are returned to your other colonies.//Each planet you have devoured counts as one foreign colony towards victory for you, even if this power is later lost or stolen. If this power is stolen, devoured planets do not transfer with it.
Loser @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Combat @ Winner loses and loser wins @ You have the power of Upset. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to declare an upset. Once an upset has been declared, both main players must play attack cards, if possible. Then, after cards are revealed, the winning side loses and the losing side wins. This occurs after all other game effects are resolved (such as the Human's power being zapped).
Love @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Colony Gain @ Makes the cosmos go 'round @ You have the power of Joy. At the start of your turn, use this power. Choose and discard one card from your hand. Every other player, in clockwise order, may then choose and discard one card from his or her hand. If he or she discards the same type as you (attack, negotiate, artifact, etc.), that player may release all of his or her ships from the warp back to colonies.//If all players discard the same type of card as you, you collect all of the discarded cards (including yours). If one or more other players do not discard a card matching the type you discarded, you may release all of your ships from the warp and use them to establish a foreign colony in the system of one of those players.
Lunatic @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Rules @ Allies against self @ You have the power of Insanity. As a main player, after allies are invited, you may use this power to ally against yourself without being invited. Your ships on the losing side are sent to the warp as normal, while your ships on the winning side receive whatever they would normally receive for winning, such as defender rewards or a colony on the defending planet.
Machine @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Rules @ Can continue turn @ You have the power of Continuity. Your turn is not limited to two encounters. After completing an encounter (whether successful or not), you may use this power to have another encounter as long as you have at least one encounter card left in your hand.
Macron @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Each ship is worth 4 @ You have the power of Mass. When you are the offense, use this power before launching in an encounter. When you are an ally, use this power after allies are invited. If you are the offense or an ally, you may only send one ship into the encounter.//As a main player or an ally, use this power after cards are revealed. Each of your ships adds 4 to your side's total in the encounter instead of 1.//When collecting compensation or rewards, each of your ships is worth two ships.
Magician @Cosmic Incursion @Red @Resource @ Steals cards, confounds opponent @ You have the power of Prestidigitation. As a main player, use this power before encounter cards are selected to force your opponent to play two encounter cards facedown. Choose one of the two cards at random and add it to your hand. Then, play an encounter card from your hand normally (even the card you just took). Your opponent must play the card you didn't choose as his or her encounter card. The rest of the encounter is resolved as usual.//If your opponent only has one encounter card left (and proves it by showing you his hand except for the encounter card), your power has no effect.
Masochist @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Rules @ Tries to lose own ships @ You have the power to Hurt Yourself. At the start of any player's regroup phase, before the offense retrieves a ship from the warp, use this power to win the game if you have lost all of your ships. Lost ships include those in the warp, those removed from the game, and those captured by other players.//You do not lose this power because of having too few home colonies, and you may still win the game via the normal manner.
Mercenary @Cosmic Incursion @Green @Resource @ Always rewarded for winning @ You have the power of Bounty Hunting. As a main player or offensive ally, after your side wins an encounter, use this power to gain defender reward as though you were a defensive ally (either retrieve one of your ships from the warp or draw one card from the deck for each ship you had in the encounter). This is in addition to any other benefits you receive normally for winning the encounter.
Merchant @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Combat @ Plays cards as extra ships @ You have the power to Hire. As a main player or ally, after encounter cards are selected, but before they are revealed, if you have at least one ship in the encounter, you may use this power to play one or more cards facedown from your hand as hired ships. These cards are treated as extra ships you have in the encounter and may be played in addition to your normal maximum of 4 ships as the offense or an ally. Hired ships cannot be played for their card effect and are not considered part of your hand. Other players may not look at or draw hired ships. Any hired ship that goes to the warp or is removed from the game is discarded. Otherwise, hired ships become normal cards again and return to your hand at the end of the encounter.
Mesmer @Cosmic Dominion @Red @Resource @ Can change own artifacts @ You have the power of Mass Hypnosis. You may use this power to play any artifact card from your hand as though it were any artifact card you name. If you are zapped you return the card to your hand, but may then play it normally, for its original printed effect, if appropriate.
Mimic @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Resource @ Copies opponent's hand size @ You have the power to Imitate. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, use this power. If your opponent has more cards in hand than you, draw cards from the deck until you have just as many cards in your hand. If your opponent has fewer cards in hand than you, discard cards of your choice until you have just as few cards in your hand.
Mind @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Resource @ Sees other players' hands @ You have the power of Knowledge. Before allies are invited in an encounter, you may use this power to look at the entire hand of one of the main players. If you are a main player, you may look at your opponent's hand. You may not tell any other players what cards you see in a player's hand using this power.
Mirage @Cosmic Dominion @Green @Combat @ Changes number of ships involved @ You have the power of Delusion. As a main player, after encounter cards are revealed, use this power to choose any one of your colonies and any one of your opponent's colonies. Encounter totals are calculated as though the main players' ships on the chosen colonies were involved instead of their actual ships in the encounter. Allies' ships count toward the totals normally.
Mirror @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Rules @ Swaps digits on attack cards @ You have the power of Reversal. As a main player, after encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, you may use this power to call for a reversal. This changes the value of any attack cards that are revealed in this encounter by reversing their digits. For example, this would make an attack 15 into a 51, a 20 into an 02, and an 08 into an 80. Resolve the encounter using these reversed values.
Miser @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Gets second hand @ Game Setup: You are dealt two separate eight-card hands. Look at them and choose one to be your "hoard". Place it facedown on this sheet.//You have the power to Hoard. Whenever you wish to play a card, you may use this power to play a card from your hoard instead of your normal hand. You may not add cards you gain to your hoard, and other players may not look at or draw cards from your hoard. If there are no encounter cards left in your hoard, you may reveal it, then discard it and get a new eight-card hoard.
Mite @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Rules @ Demands colony or loss of cards @ You have the power to Bluster. As the offense, before allies are invited, if the defense has more than three cards in hand, use this power to bluster. The defense must either discard down to three cards at random or let you establish a colony on the targeted world. If the defense gives you a colony, land any ships you have in the hyperspace gate on the targeted planet. They co-exist with the defense's ships, which do not go to the warp, and the encounter immediately ends successfully. If the defense discards down to three cards at random, the encounter continues normally.
Mouth @Cosmic Storm @Red @Resource @ Gobbles up cards @ You have the Power to Gobble. As a main player, after alliances are formed, whenever a card would be placed in the discard pile by the opposing main player or one of that player's allies, use this power to gobble up the card instead. When you gobble up a card, it is placed facedown on this sheet.//At the end of the resolution phase, if there are five or more cards on this sheet, use this power to belch one of those cards back up, placing it in your hand. The rest of the cards on this sheet are removed from the game.
Muckraker @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Rules @ Gets allies thrown out @ You have the power to Slander. As a main player or ally, at the start of the resolution phase, you may use this power to discard one card from your hand and accuse any or all winning allies of subversive intent. Each accused ally may bribe you to cancel your accusation against him or her by giving you, from his or her hand, any non-encounter card or a card of the same type (attack, negotiate, etc.) as the one you discarded. Attack card bribes must have a higher value than the attack card you discarded. Accused allies who cannot or do not bribe you must return their ships to their other colonies, and receive no rewards, colonies, or other benefits of winning the encounter.//If you are an ally and your side won, the main player on your side may exempt any or all allies from this power. You may not accuse yourself.
Mutant @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Maintains 8-card hand @ You have the power to Regenerate. As a main player, before allies are invited, you may use this power if you have fewer than eight cards to refill your hand. To do this you draw cards one at a time, at random, from any player(s) or from the deck. Draw until you have a full hand of eight cards.
Neighbor @Cosmic Storm @Green @Combat @ Adds all ships in system to attack @ You have the power of Community. As a main player or ally, after the main player on your side reveals an attack card, use this power to add one to your total for each ship you have in the targeted system that is not involved in the encounter.
Observer @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Allies do not go to warp @ You have the power to Protect. As an ally, whenever you should lose ships to the warp, use this power to instead return them to any of your colonies and keep using them.//As a main player, when any of your allies should lose ships to the warp, use this power to instead allow your allies to return them to any of their colonies of their choice.
Oracle @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Foresees opponent's card @ You have the power to Foresee. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, use this power to force your opponent to play his encounter card faceup. Only after you have seen your opponent's card do you select and play your card.
Outlaw @Cosmic Storm @Green @Resource @ Steals cards from opponents @ You have the Power to Waylay. As a main player, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to take one card at random from your opponent and from each of his or her allies. Add those cards to your hand.
Pacifist @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Combat @ Wins with negotiate card @ You have the power of Peace. As a main player, if you reveal a negotiate card and your opponent reveals an attack card, use this power to win the encounter. If you both reveal negotiate cards, you attempt to make a deal as usual.
Parasite @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Joins alliance at will @ You have the power to Infest. Unless specifically prevented by another game effect (such as the Force Field artifact), when it is your turn to ally, you may use this power to ally (sending one to four ships, as usual) with one side in an encounter as if you had been invited, even when you were not.
Patriot @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Rules @ Offers cards to secure loyalty @ You have the power of Loyalty. Once per encounter, you may use this power to show any player one card from your hand as a show of loyalty. If the player accepts your loyalty, he or she adds the card to his or her hand. If the player declines your loyalty, he or she must give you one of his or her ships from any colony. Place that ship on this sheet.//As a main player, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to return all ships on this sheet belonging to the opposing main player. Proceed to the resolution phase and resolve the encounter as if both players had revealed negotiate cards.
Pentaform @Cosmic Dominion @Red @Meta @ Has five life stages @ Game Setup: Draw five flares from the unused flare deck and arrange the matching alien powers in front of you as "life stages," in the order of your choosing. If any have Game Setup text or are not allowed in the current game, discard them and draw again. Remove the five flares from the game and slide this sheet partway under the leftmost life stage.//You have the power to Evolve. You use both your Pentaform power and whichever life stage it is underneath (zapping one does not zap the other).//Whenever you gain a foreign colony, use this power to move this sheet one life stage to the right (if possible). Whenever you lose a foreign colony, use this power to move this sheet one life stage to the left (if possible).
Phantasm @Cosmic Storm @Green @Combat @ Replaces encounter card @ You have the power of Instability. As a main player, after encounter cards are revealed, use this power to reveal the top card of the deck.//If it is not an encounter card, discard it. If it is an encounter card, replace one of either player's revealed encounter cards with the card from the deck, discarding the replaced card. In either case, the encounter then continues normally.
Philanthropist @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Resource @ Gives away cards @ You have the power of Giving. As a main player or ally, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to give one card from your hand to either main player (your opponent, if you are a main player). Your opponent immediately adds the card to his or her hand and may play it normally. If, after using this power, you do not have any encounter cards in your hand and you are a main player, you draw a new hand.
Pickpocket @Cosmic Dominion @Green @Resource @ Lifts cards from other players @ You have the power to Lift. Once per encounter, you may use this power to take one card at random from the hand of any other player who has a foreign colony in your system. Add the card to your hand or discard it.
Pirate @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Resource @ Captures ships for booty @ You have the power to Raid. As the offense or an ally, if your side wins the encounter, you may use this power. Capture one or more ships from the losing side by returning an equal number of your winning ships to your other colonies (they do not land on the targeted planet, receive rewards, or gain other benefits from winning). Place the captured ships on this sheet.//During any regroup phase, you may send up to four ships from this sheet to the warp to receive an equal number of rewards.//During any regroup phase, you may negotiate the release of any or all ships on this sheet (back to colonies) in exchange for anything their owners may legally give you in a deal, such as cards from their hands or new colonies where they already have one (although this does not count as a deal).
Plant @Cosmic Incursion @Red @Meta @ Accumulates opponents' powers @ You have the power of Grafting. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to graft any one player in whose home system you have at least one colony. If that player has not lost his or her power, you steal that power until the end of the encounter. If you lose your own power, you may not graft any power until you get your own back.
Poison @Cosmic Alliance @Red @Combat @ Has hazardous home system @ You have the power of Toxicity. Each time a card with a hazard warning is drawn from the destiny deck, use this power. Each foreign colony in your home system loses one ship to the warp.//In addition, as a main player, if both players reveal attack cards and your opponent's attack card value is within 2 of your attack card's value (such as an attack 04 and an attack 06), you may use this power to win the encounter, regardless of the actual totals.
Porcupine @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Hand Management @ Discard cards for attack power @ You have the power to Needle. As a main player or ally, if both players revealed attack cards and your side would lose the encounter, you may use this power to discard any number of cards from your hand. Then, add or subtract for your side's total an amount equal to the number of cards you discarded.
Prophet @Cosmic Conflict @Red @Resource @ Predicts encounter winner @ You have the power to Predict. If you are not involved as a main player or ally in an encounter, you may use this power before encounter cards are selected to predict aloud which main player (offense or defense) will win. A deal counts as a win. If you are correct, you gain a colony on any one planet of your choice. If you are not correct, the winner selects any two of your ships and sends them to the warp.
Pygmy @Cosmic Alliance @Green @Rules @ Colonies count as half @ Game Setup: Choose one unused player color and place the five extra planets in your home system (four in a four-planet game). Place two of your ships on each of your home planets. Your player color is the color of your ships.//You have the power of Half. Each of your home worlds counts as only half of a foreign colony for all other players (rounding down). There can never be more than four ships on any of your planets (counting yours). When determining landing order, use the timing rules. Your power cannot be zapped, lost, stolen, or copied through any means.
Quartermaster @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Resource @ Delivers rewards @ You have the power to Supply. Whenever other player(s) should receive rewards, use this power. Those players announce how many rewards of each kind they will receive. You decide which colonies their ships return to. Then, you draw all of their cards together, look at them, and deliver the appropriate number to each player as you choose. If multiple sources are involved (e.g., the cosmic and reward decks), you must draw the cards as announced but may deliver them as you choose, as long as each player receives the correct number.//If you are due rewards as well, receive yours afterwards. Otherwise, when delivering the others' rewards you may either retrieve one of your ships from the warp, or draw one extra card from a deck those rewards came from, include that card in your delivery decisions, and keep whichever card is left over for yourself.
Reactor @Cosmic Dominion @Red @Rules @ Makes aliens super @ Game Setup: Before flares are added to the deck, take the flares that match all other players' alien powers and place them faceup on this sheet. Cards on this sheet are not part of your hand. The other flares are shuffled into the deck as usual.//You have the power of Radiation. As an ally, if the main player on your side wins the encounter and his or her matching flare(s) are on this sheet, use this power to give that player his or her matching flare(s).//If neither main player invites you to ally and one of them loses the encounter, you may add the losing main player's matching flare(s) to your hand from this sheet, discard that player's matching flare(s) from your hand, or add your own matching flare(s) to your hand from this sheet.//When any player's matching flare is discarded by a player other than you, use this power to place that flare on this sheet.
Reborn @Cosmic Alliance @Green @Hand Management @ Filters hand of cards @ You have the power of Rebirth. For each ship you lose to the warp, you may use this power to draw a card.//For each ship you retrieve from the warp, you may use this power to discard a card of your choice from your hand.
Reincarnator @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Meta @ Uses powers not in game @ You have the power of Reincarnation. As a main player or ally, when you lose an encounter (or fail to deal), use this power to reincarnate. Draw an alien power card at random from the unused pile and become that alien. If the alien has Game Setup text or is not allowed in the current game, draw again. If you lose a later encounter, discard that alien and draw a new one. This power stays with you while you use the others. Aliens with the power to copy your power may do so (copying both your Reincarnator power and whatever power you are reincarnated as), but if they lose an encounter while doing so they must reincarnate, losing their original power.
Relic @Cosmic Conflict @Red @Colony Gain @ Gains power from new hands @ You have the power to Awaken. Any time another player draws a new hand of cards (after their initial hand) use this power to immediately gain a free foreign colony on their home system on a planet of your choice.//Any time you draw a new hand of cards (after your initial hand) use this power to retrieve all of your ships from the warp, returning them to your colonies.
Remora @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Resource @ Gets cards or ships with others @ You have the power to Cling. Whenever another player retrieves one or more ships from the warp, you may use this power to retrieve one of your ships from the warp as well. You may not retrieve a ship from the warp during the same encounter in which it went to the warp.//Whenever another player draws one or more cards from the deck, you may use this power to draw one card from the deck as well.
Remote @Cosmic Alliance @Red @Combat @ Forces others to ally @ You have the power to Control. As a main player, after your side wins an encounter, you may use this power to turn one ship in the encounter belonging to one opposing player into a remote. To turn a ship into a remote, remove the ship from the game and place it on this sheet.//As a main player, you may use this power to activate one or more of your remotes after allies are invited. Send each activated remote to the warp. Then, the players who own the activated remotes are forced to ally with you for this encounter and must each send four ships. A player must send all his or her ships if he or she has less than four. A controlled player must abandon home and/or foreign colonies to send the requisite four ships, if necessary. You cannot activate a remote belonging to the opposing main player during an encounter.
Reserve @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Combat @ Can use attacks as reinforcements @ You have the power to Reinforce. As a main player or ally, after encounter cards are revealed, you may use this power to play one or more attack cards of 06 or less from your hand as if they were reinforcement cards of their listed value.//As a main player or ally, when another player plays a reinforcement card, you may use this power and discard a negotiate card to cancel and discard that reinforcement card.
Roach @Cosmic Storm @Red @Resource @ Spawns additional ships @ Game Setup: Choose one unused player color and place the 20 ships of that color on this sheet (16 if you are playing with four planets per player). Ships of this color are your roach ships. When not on this sheet, roach ships function as normal ships in every way. Do not use this power unless you have an unused player color.//You have the power to Breed. When you are determined to be the defense during another player's turn, you may use this power to place up to four ships from this sheet among the planets in your home system, including planets where you have no current colony.//During your regroup phase, you may use this power to place up to four ships from this sheet among your colonies outside of your home system.//Whenever a roach ship would be sent to the warp, it is placed on this sheet instead.//This alien power cannot be stolen, copied, or separated from your player color through any means. You do not lose this power because of having too few home colonies.
Saboteur @Cosmic Conflict @Red @Rules @ Booby traps planets @ Game Setup: Take one trap token and two decoy tokens per player (including yourself). Place these tokens face down next to any planets of your choice. Place no more than one token next to a given planet.//You have the power to Booby Trap. Any time ships land on a planet with one of your tokens next to it, use this power to reveal the token. If the revealed token is a decoy, return the token to this sheet. If the token is a trap, send all ships on the planet (including those that just landed) to the warp and then return the token to this sheet.//At the start of each encounter, you may either swap any two of your tokens (whether next to a planet or on this sheet) or take a token on this sheet and place it facedown next to any planet that doesn't already have one of your tokens next to it.
Sadist @Cosmic Conflict @Red @Rules @ Wins by killing others' ships @ You have the power to Inflict Pain. At the start of any player's regroup phase, before the offense retrieves a ship from the warp, use this power to win the game if all other players have lost at least eight ships. Lost ships include ships in the warp, ships removed from the game, and ships captured by other players.//You may still win the game via the normal manner.
Sapient @Cosmic Alliance @Green @Combat @ Adds wisdom points @ You have the power of Wisdom. Each time you win an encounter as an ally, place one token on this sheet. Each time you lose an encounter as an ally, place a number of tokens equal to the number of your ships involved in the encounter on this sheet. In either case, add one extra token if playing with four planets per player.//As an ally, after the main players reveal attack cards during an encounter, use this power to add 1 to your side's total for each token on this sheet. Doing so does not cause you to discard tokens.
Scavenger @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Resource @ Searches discard pile @ You have the power to Scavenge. Whenever you lose a colony, you may use this power to search the discard pile, take one card of your choice, and add it to your hand. Whenever you would place one or more cards in the discard pile, you must instead place those cards faceup on this sheet. Cards on this sheet are not part of your hand. These cards are added to the discard pile whenever it is reshuffled to form a new deck.//You do not lose this power because of having too few home colonies.
Schizoid @Cosmic Alliance @Red @Rules @ Changes goal of game @ Game Setup: Take the six schizoid cards, choose one of them, and place it facedown on this sheet. Take the other five schizoid cards and place them facedown in a deck near this sheet.//You have the power to Alter Reality. The schizoid card that is facedown on this sheet lists the victory conditions players must fulfill in order to win the game with a normal victory. The conditions on this schizoid card replace the normal victory condition of accumulating enough foreign colonies to win. Alternate victory conditions (such as those of the Masochist or Tick-tock) are not affected by this power. Any player who has completed the normal victory condition may play a "Cosmic Zap" on you at any time to win the game.//Each time you are on the losing side of an encounter, the winning main player randomly chooses a card from the schizoid deck and reveals it to the winner(s) of the encounter. Then, shuffle the chosen card back into the deck.
Seeker @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Rules @ Asks "yes or no" question @ You have the power of Truth. As a main player or an ally, you may use this pwoer after alliances are formed but before encounter cards are selected to as one "yes or no" question of one of the main players (your opponent, if you are a main player). That player must answer your question truthfully. If your question involves the player's intentions during this encounter (such as "Are you going to play a negotiate this encounter?"), he or she must abide by his or her answer. Once this encounter ends, the player is no longer bound by his or her answer.
Shadow @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Rules @ Removes others' ships @ You have the power to Execute. Whenever any other player's color or a special destiny card that targets another player is drawn from the destiny deck, use this power to choose one of that player's ships from any colony of your choice and send it to the warp. On a wild destiny card, you may execute one ship belonging to any other player regardless of who the offense chooses to attack.
Siren @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Resource @ Entices challengers @ You have the power to Lure. Any time a player in whose home system you have a colony is chosen as the defense, you may use this power to aim the hyperspace gate at one of your home planets on which you have a colony (your choice which) and become the defense instead. The encounter then continues normally.//Any time you win an encounter as the defense, you immediately gain a free foreign colony in the offense's home system on a planet of your choice.
Skeptic @Cosmic Alliance @Yellow @Resource @ Doubles risk of encounter @ You have the power to Doubt. As a main player or ally, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to tell the opposing player: "I doubt that you will win." If the opposing player agrees with you and is the offense, that player ends his or her turn and all ships in the hyperspace gate return to their other colonies. If the opposing player agrees and is the defense, all offensive ships in the hyperspace gate establish a colony on the planet as if they had won (although defending ships already on the planet remain) and defending allies return to their other colonies.//If the opposing player disagrees or "double doubts" you, encounter cards are played. If one side loses or a deal fails, double the number of ships normally lost by either you or the opposing main player.
Sloth @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Uncategorised @ Shows up at last minute @ Game Setup: Take the sloth token and place it on this sheet.//You have the power of Laziness. As the offense or an ally, when you should send your ships into the encounter, use this power to send the sloth token in their place instead deciding how many ships to commit. The sloth token is not a ship.//After encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, replace the sloth token with 0 to 4 of your ships from any of your colonies. Then, return the sloth token to this sheet.//If you replace the cloth token with zero ships as the offense, you must still continue your encounter. If you replace the sloth token with zero ships as an ally, you are no longer an ally.
Sneak @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Colony Gain @ Colonizes attacker @ You have the power to Infiltrate. As the defense, after you lose an encounter that results in losing one of your home colonies, you may use this power to immediately place your ships from the losing encounter on any one planet in the offense's home system instead of sending them to the warp.//You do not lose this power because of having too few home colonies.
Sniveler @Cosmic Incursion @Yellow @Resource @ Catches up when behind @ You have the power to Whine. As a main player, before allies are invited, if You have the most ships in the warp, have the fewest foreign colonies of any player, or lack an encounter card you want, you may use this power to whine about it. If you whine about your ships, either all other players must agree to let you retrieve all your ships from the warp, or (if possible) they each must place ships into the warp until each matches your number there. If you whine about colonies, the other players must agree to let you have one extra foreign colony of your choice or they each lose one foreign colony of their choice, returning those ships to their other colonies. If you whine about cards, you name a card you don't have (e.g., "I don't have an attack card higher than a 15"). Either one player must give you such a card or all players must discard all such cards in their hands. Whine only once per encounter.
Sorcerer @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Can switch played cards @ You have the power of Magic. As a main player, after encounter cards are selected, but before they are revealed, you may use this power to switch encounter cards with your opponent so that he or she reveals your card and you reveal your opponent's card.
Spiff @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Colony Gain @ Receives colony as loser @ You have the power to Crash Land. As the offense, when you lose an encounter, if both players revealed attack cards and you lose the encounter by 10 or more, you may use this power to land one of your ships that would otherwise be lost to the warp on the winning defensive planet. The ship coexists with the ships already there. This power does not allow you to coexist in places or with aliens that state otherwise.
Squee @Cosmic Storm @Red @Rules @ Is dangerously adorable @ You have the power of Unimaginable Cuteness. As the defense, after encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, you may use this power to bat your eyes at the offense and look too adorable to attack. The offense must choose whether to concede or continue.//If the offense chooses to concede, you win the encounter. Immediately proceed to the resolution phase. The played encounter cards will be discarded as usual.//If the offense chooses to continue, the offense must send any three of his or her ships to the warp. If the offense reveals an attack card and wins the encounter, you collect compensation even if you did not reveal a negotiate card.
Sting @Cosmic Alliance @Yellow @Resource @ Switches lost ships @ You have the power to Substitute. Each time you lose ships to the warp, you may use this power to designate another player to substitute half the lost ships instead. Return half of your lost ships (rounded down) to your colonies. Then, your substitute makes up for the saved ships by choosing an equal number of his or her own ships to lose to the warp. That player may then draw one card from your hand for each ship he or she lost. If you have too few cards, that player may draw the remainder needed from the deck.
Swindler @Cosmic Storm @Red @Rules @ Steals a player's identity @ Game Setup: Take one swindler token for each other player in the game, making sure that one of these is the mark token with the "X" on its front. Secretly look at these tokens and place one token facedown next to each other player's alien sheet. The player to whom you assigned the mark token is your "mark." You may look at these tokens at any time, but the other players cannot.//As the original Swindler, You have the power of Identity Theft. After the defense has been determined, you may use this power. Reveal your mark by flipping all swindler tokens faceup and removing them from the game. You and your mark then exchange everything in the game, including physical seats, alien powers, player colors, ships, hands, systems, planets, colonies, etc. The encounter continues, although this may change who the main player(s) are. If the offense's color has become controlled by a different player, it is now that player's turn instead of the original offense's turn.//As the revealed mark, You have the power to Panic. During each other player's start turn phase, you may use this power to immediately gain a colony in the offense's home system.//This alien power cannot be stolen, copied, or separated from your player color through any means.
Sycophant @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Rules @ Wins through flattery @ Game Setup: Place 10 tokens on this sheet (eight if playing with four planets per player).//You have the power of Flattery. If you are not a main player, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to flatter one of the main players (even if you are allied against that player). If the player you flatter wins the encounter or makes a deal, discard one token from this sheet. If there are no more tokens on this sheet, you immediately win the game. You may still win the game via the normal method.
Symbiote @Cosmic Incursion @Green @Resource @ Has twice as many ships @ Game Setup: Choose one unused player color and take the 20 ships in that color (16 in a 4-planet game), placing twice as many ships as usual on each of your planets. Your player color is that of the planets you use. Do not use this power unless you have an unused player color.//You have the power of Symbiosis. You have twice as many ships as normal. Your power cannot be zapped, lost, stolen, or copied through any means.
The Claw @Cosmic Conflict @Red @Resource @ Steals planets @ Game Setup: Choose one non-negotiate card from your starting hand to be your "claw" and place it face down on this sheet; then draw a card from the deck.//You have the power of The Claw. Your claw is not considered part of your hand. Other players may not look at or draw it. At the start of any regroup phase, you may swap a card from your hand with your claw.//Once per encounter, when another player plays a copy of the card you have chosen as your claw, use this power and reveal your claw. After the end of the current encounter, choose a planet in that player's home system and move it to your home system, sending any ships on it to the warp and making it a new home planet for yourself (although you do not get to establish a colony on it). Then, return your claw card to your hand and choose a card from your hand to become your new claw.//Each stolen planet in your home system counts as a foreign colony towards your win, even if inhabited by other players. If you gain a colony on a stolen planet in your home system, that colony counts as a home colony for you, not a foreign colony.
Tick-Tock @Cosmic Encounter @Yellow @Rules @ Limits length of game @ Game setup: Place ten tokens on this sheet (eight if playing with four planets per player).//You have the power of Patience. Each time any player wins an encounter as the defense or a successful deal is made between any two players, use this power to discard one token from this sheet. If there are no more tokens on this sheet, you immediately win the game. You may still win the game via the normal method.
Tide @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Resource @ Makes players draw or discard @ Game Setup: Place two cosmic tokens on this sheet.//You have the power to Ebb and Flow. After you win an encounter as a main player, use this power to place one token on this sheet. Then, you and each of your allies draw one card from the deck for each token on this sheet.//After you lose an encounter as a main player, if there is more than one token on this sheet, use this power to discard one token from this sheet. Then, the opposing main player and each of his or her allies must discard one card of their choice from their hands for each token on this sheet.
Tourist @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Resource @ Travels on cruise liner @ Game Setup: Place the cruise liner token in your system. Now and each time the cruise liner enters your system, you may move up to four of your ships from your home colonies onto it, or vice versa.//You have the power to Sightsee. At the end of the destiny phase, if any hazard warnings were drawn during this encounter, use this power to send one of your ships to the warp from the cruise liner.//If no hazard warnings were drawn, use this power to move the cruise liner one system clockwise or counterclockwise. Then, if the cruise liner is in the defense's system and you do not already have a colony in that system, you may use this power to disembark all of your ships from the cruise liner to any one planet there. If for any reason you do not disembark, you may use this power to send a postcard home. Return one ship from the cruise liner to any of your colonies, and then take a card at random from the hand of that system's player.
Trader @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Trades hands with opponent @ You have the power of Transference. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to trade hands with your opponent. You each then keep the new hand.
Trickster @Cosmic Conflict @Green @Combat @ Wins encounters 50% of the time @ You have the power of Possibilities. As a main player, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to manipulate probability instead of having a normal encounter. If you do so, take a cosmic token and conceal it secretly in one of your hands. The other main player then chooses one of your closed fists. You then open both of your fists, revealing which hand held the token. If your opponent chose the hand containing the token, you lose the encounter. If he or she chose your empty hand, you win the encounter. In either case, the resolution phase is then carried out as normal.
Tripler @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Combat @ Low cards triple, high cards 1/3 @ You have the power of Thrice. As a main player, after you reveal an attack card, use this power to adjust its value. If the card's value is 10 or less, triple its value. If the card's value is more than 10, divide its value by three (rounded up).
Tyrant @Cosmic Storm @Red @Resource @ Claims other players' ships @ You have the power to Subjugate. As a main player, when you win an encounter after revealing an attack card, use this power to subjugate one involved ship from each player on the losing side. Subjugated ships are captured and placed on this sheet instead of being sent to the warp.//When you are determined to be the defense against a player whose ships you have subjugated, use this power to force that player to discard one card at random for each of his or her subjugated ships.//When you are the offense and having an encounter with a player whose ships you have subjugated, after you reveal an attack card, use this power to add the number of that player's subjugated ships to your total.//When you would be forced to send ships to the warp, you may choose to send subjugated ships to the warp instead. You may choose to release subjugated ships as part of a deal. When a ship is removed from this sheet, it is no longer subjugated.
Usurper @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Rules @ Makes allies play encounter cards @ You have the power to Accroach. As a main player, you may use this power immediately after encounter cards are selected (before any other game effects that apply after card selection). Every ally must play one encounter card facedown from his or her hand (first drawing a new hand if out of encounter cards). Look at the cards played by your allies. You may select one of them to replace your encounter card. You may select one of the opposing allies' cards (without looking at them) to replace your opponent's card. All replaced and unused cards return to their owners' hands and the encounter continues.//If a main player's encounter card selection is forced by a game effect such as Oracle, Magician, or Visionary, this power does not affect his or her allies.
Vacuum @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Takes other ships to warp @ You have the power of Catharsis. Whenever you lose ships to the warp, use this power to take along up to an equal number of other ships. You specify which players must lose them, and how many each player must lose. The targeted players decide which colony or colonies the ships are taken from. Ships lost to the Vacuum this way are in addition to any ships normally lost in an encounter.
Virus @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Combat @ Multiplies in attack @ You have the power to Multiply. As a main player, after you reveal an attack card in an encounter, use this power to multiply the number of ships you have in the encounter times the value of your card instead of adding. Your allies' ships are still added to your total as usual.
Visionary @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Rules @ Dictates encounter card @ You have the power of Perception. As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may use this power to specify an encounter card that your opponent must play (for instance: "You will play an attack 06"). If your opponent does not have such a card, he or she may play any encounter card he or she wishes. If your opponent dos have the card, however, he or she must play it unless prevented by another player.
Void @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Rules @ Eradicates opponents' ships @ You have the power to Eradicate. As a main player, when you win an encounter, use this power to remove the losing side's ships from the game rather than sending them to the warp. A player cannot be reduced to fewer ships than the number of foreign colonies needed to win the game. Any eradicated ships that would reduce a player below this number are sent to the warp as normal.
Vox @Cosmic Storm @Green @Combat @ Goes up to eleven @ You have the power of Volume. As a main player or offensive ally, after encounter cards are revealed, you may use this power to choose one revealed attack card with a value lower than 11. That card goes up to 11.
Voyager @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Colony Gain @ Can have a colony in the warp @ You have the power to Journey. At the start of your turn, you may use this power to move one of your home planets into the warp if you do not already have one there, or to exchange one of your home planets with one of your planets in the warp. Ships on that planet are both on a colony and in the warp, and may/must leave through all the usual ways for both. Ships sent to the warp do not land on the planet, but ships returning to colonies may go to a colony already on the warp-world.//Your colony on a warp-world counts as both a foreign and home colony, but other players' colonies there count as neither. If this sheet is lost or turned facedown, return the warp-world to your system.
Vulch @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Collects discarded artifacts @ You have the power to Salvage. Whenever any other player discards an artifact card (whether after playing it or not), use this power to add the artifact to your hand. Any artifact cards you play are discarded as normal and cannot be salvaged.//If you draw a new hand, you keep your old artifacts after revealing them, then draw eight new cards in addition to the artifacts.
Warhawk @Cosmic Conflict @Yellow @Combat @ Never negotiates @ You have the power to Attack. As a main player, when your opponent reveals a negotiate card, use this power to change it into an attack 00.//As a main player, when you reveal a negotiate card, use this power to change it into a morph card.//As a main player, if both you and your opponent reveal negotiate cards, use this power to change both negotiates into attack 00 cards.
Warpish @Cosmic Encounter @Red @Combat @ Adds ships in warp to total @ You have the power of Necromancy. As a main player, after you reveal an attack card in an encounter, use this power to add 1 to your total for each ship (yours or otherwise) in the warp.
Warrior @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Combat @ Adds experience points @ You have the power of Mastery. After an encounter in which you were a main player, add one token to this sheet if you won that encounter (or made a deal during it) or two tokens if you lost that encounter (or failed to make a deal during it). In either case, add one extra token if playing with four planets per player.//As a main player, after you reveal an attack card in an encounter, use this power to add 1 to your total for each token you have on this sheet. Tokens are not discarded from this sheet after doing so.
Whirligig @Cosmic Dominion @Green @Resource @ Mixes two hands @ You have the power to Swirl. As a main player, during the planning phase, you may use this power to mix the other main player's hand with your own. You and your opponent put your hands facedown on the table, and you mix them together. Then, choose how they will be returned://• Even Steven: Both players get an equal number of cards. If there is an odd number, you get the extra card. • As Is: Each player gets the same number of cards they originally had. • Switcheroo: Each player gets the number of cards the other player originally had.//Once you decide, the other main player takes his or her assigned number of cards at random from the mixed hands. You take the rest.
Will @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Rules @ Not controlled by destiny @ You have the power of Choice. As the offense, after you draw from the destiny deck, use this power to encounter any alien on any planet of your choice instead of encountering the alien mandated by the drawn destiny card (for example, you could choose to encounter the Virus' ships on the Mind's planet, even if you were actually directed to have an encounter with the Oracle by the destiny card). Any other effects caused by the drawn destiny card still take place as usual.
Winner @Cosmic Alliance @Yellow @Rules @ Gains extra colonies @ You have the power to Win More. As a main player, after both players reveal attack cards and you win the encounter by 10 or more, use this power to immediately gain one free foreign colony on a planet of your choice in any system.
Worm @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Rules @ Re-aims hyperspace gate @ Game Setup: You may distribute your ships among your planets however you wish as long as there is at least one ship on each planet.//You have the power to Tunnel. As a main player, after encounter cards are revealed, you may use this power to re-aim the hyperspace gate anywhere the offense can have a legal encounter against the defense (in any system), as long as the offense does not already have a colony there. All offensive and allied ships move along with the gate and the encounter continues normally.
Wormhole @Cosmic Storm @Yellow @Resource @ Commits ships from warp @ You have the power to Translocate. As the offense or an ally, when committing ships to an encounter, you may use this power to commit your ships from the warp and/or from your colonies. As a main player, whenever one of your allies commits ships to the encounter, you may use this power to allow that ally to commit those ships from the warp and/or from his or her colonies.//This power does not allow players to exceed the normal limit of four ships in the encounter.
Xenophile @Cosmic Conflict @Green @Combat @ Gains strength from "tourists" @ You have the power of Welcoming. As a main player, after both main players reveal attack cards, use this power to add or subtract 3 from your side's total for each foreign colony in your home system.//You do not lose your power because of having too few home colonies.
Yin-Yang @Cosmic Dominion @Yellow @Alliance @ Allies with both sides @ You have the power of Balance. When you are invited to join both sides of an encounter, you may use this power to ally with both sides. If you ally with both sides and the defense loses, for each ship you have allied with the offense, the defense may keep one of his or her losing ships on the planet instead of sending it to the warp. If you ally with both sides and the offense loses, for each ship you have allied with the defense, the offense may receive one reward.//When a main player declines to invite you to ally, you may give that player one of your yin-yang tokens. Each main player who has a yin-yang token when his or her opponent loses ships to the warp from the encounter must lose an equal number of ships from his or her colonies. At the end of each encounter, place both yin-yang tokens on this sheet.
Zombie @Cosmic Encounter @Green @Resource @ Never goes to warp @ You have the power of Immortality. Whenever you should lose ships to the warp, use this power to instead return them to any of your colonies and keep using them.//In addition, you may free any player's ships from the warp (back to any colonies he or she has) as part of a deal.
